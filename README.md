# Algoprog-Final

This is the repository for the Final Project of class Algorithm and Programming on the year 2024 B28 submission
The assets are from https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack and maps are made using Tiled (https://www.mapeditor.org)
backsound music was taken from Hollow Knight's Music Album.

The project was inspired by Zelda and Elden Ring, exploring the area and defeating enemies will gain experience which can be used to upgrade the player's stats. The project's tile size is 64 and current set FPS is 60, the screen's resolution is on 1280 x 720, which can be used to be full screen if changed to the corresponding monitor's resolution. The game is incomplete as the skin system is not yet fully functional.

There are currently 3 Skins that can be changed manually which are Default, Timo, and Jude. If you want to change the skin, you can go to skin.py and find "skin_path" change it to the corresponding name and the player's appearance should change (The skin feature is incomplete)

# Thing's to do for the game to work

- Download all assets and dependencies from the repository
- make sure python is downloaded
- make sure pygame library is downloaded
- go to settings.py and search for the variable called "init_path" and change it to the current folder directory that you're using to run the game from
- All done and you can start up the game

Enjoy
